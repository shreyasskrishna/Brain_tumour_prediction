## üöÄ Project Overview

**Objective:**
Develop a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model utilizing ResNet50 and VGG16 architectures to classify brain tumors into four categories:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor

**Dataset:**
The model is trained and tested on MRI scan images categorized into:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries and Frameworks:**
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Gradio
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

### Feature Extraction:
Utilizes pre-trained models:
- ResNet50
- VGG16
- Initial layers are frozen to retain pre-trained features.

### Data Augmentation:
Techniques applied:
- Rotation
- Width and height shifts
- Shear
- Zoom
- Horizontal and vertical flips

### Fully Connected Layers:
- Global Average Pooling layers
- Dense layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification

## üìä Model Performance

**Accuracy:** 92.5%
**Precision:** 90.3%
**Recall:** 91.7%

Confusion Matrix and performance graphs can be found in the repository.
